# Note: Small files like package-lock.json (currently 128K) are intentionally 
# NOT included here as they benefit from git's delta compression and are 
# frequently updated. Only add them if they grow significantly larger.

# Exceptions for specific small files that match above patterns but should stay in git
# (Use this section to override LFS for specific files if needed)
# Example: !path/to/small-image.png
